# Parameter Search of Historical GOES XRS Data

Statistical study of parameters that may be utilized as triggers for a sounding rocket launch. The parameter search utilizes the specific timing of the FOXSI/HI-C rocket launch timing, and utilizes the FOXSI/HI-C science goals as success criteria. For all combinations of parameters, results as to what FOXSI/HI-C would launch on and observe are simulated for every trigger combination, tested on approx. 10,500 flares. 

To run a parameter search assuming FOXSI launches first, with HI-C launching 1 minute later: perform tests in the `BOTH_PARAMSEARCH` folder.

To run a parameter search assuming only FOXSI or Hi-C are launching: choose either the `FOXSI_PARAMSEARCH` or  `HIC_PARAMSEARCH` folder. 

yay!!
